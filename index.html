the description for Edda on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &quot;Edda&quot; (/ˈɛdə/; Old Norse Edda, plural Eddur) applies to 
the Old Norse Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, both of which were written 
down in Iceland during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they 
contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the 
Viking Age. The books are the main sources of medieval skaldic tradition 
in Iceland and Norse mythology. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Runic alphabets, in particular <em>futhark</em> (&quot;th&quot; is the thorn: þ, fuþark), 
was used by Scandanavian (Norse) and its use was noted use in Eddic lore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Norse mythology, the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin 
(Old Norse: reginkunnr). This is attested as early as on the Noleby 
Runestone from approximately 600 AD that reads Runo fahi raginakundo 
toj[e&#39;k]a..., meaning &quot;I prepare the suitable divine rune...&quot; and in 
an attestation from the 9th century on the Sparlösa Runestone, which 
reads Ok rað runaR þaR rægi[n]kundu, meaning &quot;And interpret the runes 
of divine origin&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>J.R.R. Tolkien used derivatives of <em>futhark</em> to describe the alphabet
used by the dwarves and even created his own called <em>Cirth</em>.</p>
<p>Well, what does this all mean for our logo? It&#39;s the transliterated
version of EDDA into <em>elder futhark</em>.</p>

<li>E = ehwaz = &quot;M&quot; like character</li>
<li>D = dagaz = &quot;infinity&quot; like character</li>
<li>A = ansuz = &quot;F&quot; like character</li>

resolution, users will have to review and identify regions of interest by
transforming data into compact information descriptors that characterize
simulation results and allow detailed analysis on demand. This is because
exascale architectures will be much more constrained with respect to data
movement, and <em>in situ</em> data processing will be the norm, where the goals are to
fit the total amount of output data within a budget, to summarize and triage
data based on content, and to classify and index data to facilitate efficient
offline analysis. In addition, <em>in situ</em> analysis must be performed in a time 
and space efficient fashion, not only to avoid slowing down the simulation, but
also to not consume too much memory.  </p>
<p>Among many different feature descriptors,
the statistical information derived from data samples is a promising approach
to taming the big data avalanche, because data distributions computed from a
population can compactly describe the presence and characteristics of salient
features with minimal data movement.  The ability to computationally summarize
and process data using distributions provides an efficient and representative
capture of the information content of a large-scale data set. This
representation can adjust to size and resource constraints, with the added
benefit that uncertainty can be quantified and communicated.  </p>
<p>In this project,
<em>we posit that with the growing number of cores per node, with increasing memory
and I/O constraints in emerging extreme-scale platforms, it will be feasible
and desirable to compute distributions at simulation time, perform
memory-efficient</em> in situ <em>analysis using distributions, and save distributions
as a space-efficient summarization for on-demand, offline visualization and
analysis of salient features.</em> The key development will be a novel
distribution-based analysis and visualization framework based on in situ pro-
cessing of extreme-scale scientific data. Our goals are to ensure that
scientists can easily obtain an overview of the entire data set regardless of
the size of the simulation; understand the characteristics and locations of the
features; easily interact with the data and select regions and features of
interest; and perform all the analysis tasks with a small memory footprint.</p>
