**Preliminary Results**

[Nyx](https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Nyx), a DOE cosmological model,
simulates the evolution of the large-scale structures in the universe,
given the "initial conditions" of the universe. Though, it is not clear
what initial conditions match the observable universe, thus part of the
science is to find the parameterization of the simulations that best
match the observed universe.

The cosmologists are typically interested in three to
ten of these initial parameters of interest, which creates huge parameter space
to search for the best matching conditions. With high-resolution simulations,
each simulation will generate multiple quantities of interest, on a high-resolution
grid, such as 4096^3. These simulations generate massive amounts of data
and performing data analysis will be slow, due to the limited I/O bandwidth
compared to the amount of raw data, in addition to limited storage capabilities.

To tackle the problem of analysis of massive data for cosmological studies,
we are studying techniques to reduce the overall data size, but keep
enough precision for high-fidelity statistical analysis. We have
developed a preliminary *Gaussian Mixture Model-based (GMM) Emulator*
to achieve our goal. The GMM-based Emulator uses multi-variate GMM methods
to compactly summarize the data from simulations by modeling the cosmological
data with Gaussian distributions. This allows the cosmologists to reconstruct
the data for any set of initial conditions, as well as predict the data for
simulations that have not been run yet. With 5 Gaussians, we are able to
reduce the data to 7.5% of its original size with RMSE within the 1% error
regime, which is acceptable for statistical studies of cosmological data.
