The acronym for our project is EDDA, which if you google for it you find
the description for Edda on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edda).

> The term "Edda" (/ˈɛdə/; Old Norse Edda, plural Eddur) applies to 
> the Old Norse Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, both of which were written 
> down in Iceland during the 13th century in Icelandic, although they 
> contain material from earlier traditional sources, reaching into the 
> Viking Age. The books are the main sources of medieval skaldic tradition 
> in Iceland and Norse mythology. 

Runic alphabets, in particular *futhark* ("th" is the thorn), 
was used by Scandanavian (Norse) and its use was noted use in Eddic lore.

> In Norse mythology, the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin 
> (Old Norse: reginkunnr). This is attested as early as on the Noleby 
> Runestone from approximately 600 AD that reads Runo fahi raginakundo 
> toj[e'k]a..., meaning "I prepare the suitable divine rune..." and in 
> an attestation from the 9th century on the Sparlösa Runestone, which 
> reads Ok rað runaR þaR rægi[n]kundu, meaning "And interpret the runes 
> of divine origin".

J.R.R. Tolkien used derivatives of *futhark* to describe the alphabet
used by the dwarves and even created his own called *Cirth*.

Well, what does this all mean for our logo? It's the transliterated
version of EDDA into *elder futhark*.
