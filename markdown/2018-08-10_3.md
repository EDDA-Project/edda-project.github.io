*Preliminary Results*

In investigating other methods to improve the quality and size reduction of
[Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM)](#Emulator-of-Cosmological-Simulation-for-Initial-Parameters-Study)
for cosmological simulations, we have studied the application of
*super-resolution* techniques applied to our statistical GMM modeling. In
machine learning, *super-resolution* methods use image training techniques
to train a dictionary of high-resolution imagery. This allows image databases
to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution samples using the
dictionary training set, to infer high-resolution information from
low-resolution data.

In our work, we investigated super-resolution reconstruction of
[Nyx](https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Nyx) simulation data
by mapping low-resolution GMM model data into a high-resolution Nyx dictionary.
This allows us both to reduce the GMM model training time, by building a lower
resolution GMM model, and still retain low reconstruction error and high
precision through the super-resolution dictionary.

Our workflow for applying the super-resolution method to scientific data follows:

1. Run Nyx for several input parameters
2. Use the high-resolution data from Nyx to generate a high-resolution dictionary
   (statistical prior knowledge)
3. Run Nyx for the rest of the input parameter space, but down-sample the data
   into low-resolution histogram data (i.e., block-wise histograms)
4. Train a GMM model on the coarse resolution data from step (3)
5. Reconstruct high resolution data by low-resolution GMM reconstruction and
   super-resolution lookup and interpolation, using data from step (2) and (4)

Our preliminary results show that we are able to simultaneously achieve low
storage sizes of approximately 3% of the original data size, and low RMSE
on average of 0.5% error for density and z-momentum, with 2% error on temperature.
This method achieves better space savings and reconstruction error than plain
GMM modeling of Nyx.
