**Problem**: The computational power of modern supercomputers allow scientists
to model physical phenomena with high-resolution simulation. However, analyzing
such large-scale scientific simulation data is challenging due to the
incompatibility between memory limitations, I/O capacities, and high
computational power. Using distribution-based representation to handle big data
sets becomes popular, but the distribution inherently lacks the spatial
information of samples and causes the low visualization quality. Developing the
technique to improve visualization quality from the distribution based
representation is necessary.

**Proposed Solution**: In addition to the traditional value distribution, we
construct and store the spatial distributions where the locations of samples
are collected and stored as a multi-dimensional distribution for each value
sub-range. Each multi-dimensional distribution is stored using compact
distribution representation which is Spatial Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The
Spatial GMM maps the locations of the data points in different value ranges to
probabilities. When visualizing the data set, we utilize our representation to
infer the probability for a value to reside at arbitrary location using Bayesâ€™
rule, which combines known information (the value distribution) and  additional
evidences (the Spatial GMMs) from a given condition. Equipped with this spatial
information, our approach produces lower variance, and hence lower uncertainty,
in the results of statistical based analysis and visualizations.
