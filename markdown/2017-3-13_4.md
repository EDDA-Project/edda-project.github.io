**Problem**: Uncertain data visualization plays a fundamental role in many
applications such as weather forecast and analysis of fluid flows. Exploring
scalar uncertain data modeled as probability distribution fields is a
challenging task because the underlying features are often more complex, and
the data associated with each grid point are high dimensional.

**Proposed Solution**: In this work, we present a compact and effective
representation called Range Likelihood Tree (RLT), to summarize and explore
probability distribution fields. The key idea is to consider the different
roles that subranges (subspaces of the value domain) may play in understanding
probability distributions, and decompose and summarize each complex probability
distribution over a few representative subranges by cumulative probabilities.
In our method, the value domain is first partitioned into subranges, then the
distribution at each grid point is transformed according to the cumulative
probabilities of the pointâ€™s distribution in those subranges. Organizing the
subranges into a hierarchical structure based on how these cumulative
probabilities are spatially distributed in the grid points, the new range
likelihood tree representation allows effective classification and
identification of features through user query and exploration. We present an
exploration framework with multiple interactive views to explore probability
distribution fields, and provide guidelines for visual exploration using our
framework.
