**Problem**: Interactive data exploration plays a fundamental role in analyzing
three dimensional scientific data. Occlusion management and feature
preservation are among the key factors to ensure effective identification and
extraction of three-dimensional features. Existing methods may not able to
combine the occlusion removal task, together with preserving features flexibly
defined by data properties, while providing interactions with real-time
performance.

**Proposed Solution**: we propose a new data exploration system that allows
direct manipulation of data with cutting and splitting capabilities. The
procedure is carried out by deforming a tetrahedral mesh that has a void in the
middle to simulate the incision created by the cut. The splitting operation
enlarges the void to allow users to observe the inner structure which was
originally occluded. Our mesh is constructed with the local data properties
taken into account, such as local data density or gradient. Therefore the
deformation will affected by the selected data property. Regions with high data
property values are more solid and harder to be deformed, while regions with
lower property values will be deformed more. Therefore the deformation can keep
interesting features of the data.
