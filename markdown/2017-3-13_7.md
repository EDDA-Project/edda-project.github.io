![Variations of Ensemble Isosurfaces](images/2017-3-13/vis_variations.png)

**Goal**: 

- To visualize the variation of ensemble surfaces for a range of isovalues.

**Implementation**: 

- Visualize the isosurface order statistics using interactive PCP
- Color mapped surface visualization showing the distance of a member from the
  median surface.  
- Volume rendered image of the distance of each point to the median surface.
