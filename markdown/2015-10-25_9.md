In the era of big data analytics, efficient data transformation and summarization is becoming a popular approach for big data handling. Since it is almost impossible to store all the raw data, an information rich data representation can benefit data analysts immensely by reducing the size of the data to a manageable scale yet preserving the features in the data with high accuracy. In order to perform this task, we need to identify data summarization techniques which are compact, easy to compute and represent. Furthermore, a comparative framework is also need to be devised which will take different data summarization techniques and compare their effectiveness in terms of several critical parameters such as representation accuracy, storage cost, computation time, errors incurred etc. This work aims at producing such a comparative framework. Majority of the data summarization techniques try to prioritize the data by partitioning it into smaller regions and summarizing each region with appropriate representatives. Each of such representation algorithms in general can be divided into three steps: (1) data partitioning, (2) partition summarization and (3) error estimation. Therefore the accuracy and effectiveness of those representative algorithms is of prime importance to data scientists. To address these requirements, we have created a score-boarding framework which accepts several data summarization techniques and performs a global scale parameter study on them. Such a parameter study scheme is able to identify data specific transformation and summarization techniques which yields the best representation for the data. Since these transformation and summarization methods can not capture all the information the data has, appropriate error metrics are also an importance parameter in this study. By performing a comprehensive parameter study on a data set, we can analyze the results and find the best scheme of data summarization and the associated combination of parameters for it. The output of our framework is a database table where we keep track of all the test combinations and the results obtained by them in terms of data reduction, effectiveness of the summarization scheme, time taken to compute etc. By querying the output database, we can easily find the most effective algorithm and the associated parameter combinations which obtained the best result.
