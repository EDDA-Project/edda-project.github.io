Approximate aggregation has been a popular approach for interactive data analysis and decision making, especially on large-scale datasets. While there is clearly a need to apply this approach for scientific datasets comprising massive arrays, existing algorithms have largely been developed for relational data, and cannot handle both dimension-based and value-based predicates efficiently while maintaining accuracy. We present a novel approach for approximate aggregations over array data, using bitmap indices or bitvectors as the summary structure, as they preserve both spatial and value distribution of the data. We develop approximate aggregation algorithms using only the bitvectors and certain additional pre-aggregation statistics (equivalent to a 1-dimensional histogram) that we require. Another key development is choosing a binning strategy that can improve aggregation accuracy -- we introduce a v-optimized binning strategy and its weighted extension, and present a bitmap construction algorithm with such binning. We compare our method with other existing methods including sampling and multi-dimensional histograms, as well as the use of other binning strategies with bitmaps. We demonstrate both high accuracy and efficiency of our approach. Specifically, we show that in most cases, our method is more accurate than other methods by at least one order of magnitude. Despite achieving much higher accuracy, our method can require significantly less storage than multi-dimensional histograms.
