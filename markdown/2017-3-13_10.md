**Scoreboard**: A community for comparing the performance of different data
triage, sampling, and summarization algorithms.

**Purpose**:
Since it is difficult to know how data reduction algorithms will
perform on data, we describe Scoreboard, a resource for sharing data
and triage algorithms in the scientific community.
The purpose of this document is to present the detailed design choices and
strategies that will be used during the development of Scoreboard. It is a
web-based system that will provide the users a set of tools for sharing the
performance of various data triage, compression, and sampling algorithms 
over the entire parameter space. This will allow application scientists
and computer scientists to collaborate on algorithms and data for
large-scale data triage.

**Features**: Scoreboard will be built on a web publishing system where the
results will be publically available. The users will be provided with an
interactive interface where they will be able to upload their testing
algorithms and the parameter list on which they expect to run the algorithms.
The results of different runs along with the parameter set used will be stored
in a database, showing how their algorithm performs on different data sets. 

After the completion of the run, the users, domain scientists, and computer
scientists will be able to analyze the performance of the algorithms in a
side-by-side fashion by performing queries the shared data. Scoreboard will
have one or more associated error metrics, which will indicate the goodness of
the triage algorithms. Hence, the users will be able to compare and contrast
different sampling, compression, and triage algorithms in terms of their error,
output data size, parameter combinations, etc. allowing them to have
the best information on choosing a set of data reduction algorithms
available.
