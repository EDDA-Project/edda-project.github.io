The MINOS Project (an NA-22 venture) has a massive amount of sensor data to
study the life cycle of a reactor facility. For example, with only one day of
electromagnetic sensor data, it contains 2 TB just for that sensor. It
desirable to compress this data to make the data movement, storage, and
analysis manageable.

Although the data appear to be unpredictable, they are not a stochastic or
random sequence-- can a machine learning model learn to predict the data, i.e.,
compress the data: Can we represent the data where the size of the model and a
subset of the data can be used to reconstruct the data at low error? In our
previous work in statistical super-resolution, we showed that this method
worked with cosmology data.

Thus, we continue to explore the possibility for machine learning models
(high-dimensional regression) to contribute to data compression techniques, by
integrating new machine learning methods with existing methods in signal
processing and compression.
