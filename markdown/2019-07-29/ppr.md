![Parallel partial reduction](images/2019-07-29/ppr.png)

We present a novel partial reduction algorithm to aggregate sparsely
distributed intermediate results that are generated by data-parallel analysis
and visualization algorithms. Applications of partial reduction include flow
trajectory analysis, big data online analytical processing, and volume
rendering. Unlike traditional full parallel reduction that exchanges dense data
across all processes, the purpose of partial reduction is to exchange only
intermediate results that correspond to the same query, such as line segments
of the same flow trajectory.

To this end, we design a three-stage algorithm that minimizes the communication
cost: (1) partitioning the result space into groups; (2) constructing and
optimizing the reduction partners for each group; and (3) initiating collective
reduction operations for all groups concurrently. Both theoretical and
empirical analyses show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional methods
when the intermediate results are sparsely distributed. We also demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm for flow visualization, big log data
analysis, and volume rendering.
