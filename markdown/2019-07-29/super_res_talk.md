Cosmologists build simulations for the evolution of the universe using
different initial parameters.  By exploring the datasets from different
simulation runs, cosmologists can understand the evolution of our universe and
approach its initial conditions. A cosmological simulation nowadays can
generate datasets on the order of petabytes.  Moving datasets from the
supercomputers to post data analysis machines is infeasible. We propose a
novel approach called statistical super-resolution to tackle the big data
problem for cosmological data analysis and visualization. It uses datasets
from a few simulation runs to create a prior knowledge, which captures the
relation between low- and high-resolution data.  We apply in situ statistical
down-sampling to datasets generated from simulation runs to minimize the
requirements of I/O bandwidth and storage.  High-resolution datasets are
reconstructed from the statistical down-sampled data by using the prior
knowledge for scientists to perform advanced data analysis and render
high-quality visualizations.
