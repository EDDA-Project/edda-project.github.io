In our project under the current funding cycle, we proposed to research and
develop methods for large-scale data analytics and visualization as applied to
scientific data ensembles in several different topic areas: 1) *Exploration of
Local Uncertainty with Distributions*, 2) *Exploration and Tracking of Ensemble
Features*, and 3) *Exploration of Multivariate Ensemble Parameters*.
Additionally, we proposed to tackle the scalability of these methods as applied
towards DOE applications of interest: 1) *Automation of In Situ Ensemble
Analytics* and 2) *Domain Specific and Laboratory Applications*. 

In the link below, we present selected results of our efforts in each of these
aforementioned areas for FY 2018.
