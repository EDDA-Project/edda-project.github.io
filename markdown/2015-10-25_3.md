The [EDDA library](https://sites.google.com/site/gravityvisdb/edda) aims at visualizing distribution data for uncertainty analysis.  

The goal is to provide a unified data model with generic distribution representations for the development of uncertainty visualization algorithms.  The distribution models to support will be parametric distributions like Gaussian and GMM, un-parametric distributions like histogram and KDE, as well as joint distributions.  These are encapsulated into C++ template classes.  Coupled with our experiences on developing regular and curvilinear-grid datasets in OSUFlow, we provide an API allowing to query for the distribution of a given 3D position.  The return of the query can be either the interpolated distribution or a Monte-Carlo sample of the distribution, depending on the need of the visualization algorithm.  We also provide distribution arithmetic and analysis tools including project ITL.
