*CoDDA (Copula-based Distribution Driven Analysis)* is a flexible framework for
large-scale multivariate datasets. A common strategy to deal with large-scale
scientific simulation data is to partition the simulation domain and create
statistical data summaries. Instead of storing the high-resolution raw data
from the simulation, storing the compact statistical data summaries results in
reduced storage overhead and alleviated I/O bottleneck. Such summaries, often
represented in the form of statistical probability distributions, can serve
various post-hoc analysis and visualization tasks. However, for multivariate
simulation data using standard multivariate distributions for creating data
summaries is not feasible. They are either storage inefficient or are
computationally expensive to be estimated in simulation time (in situ) for
large number of variables. In this work, using copula functions, we propose a
flexible multivariate distribution-based data modeling and analysis framework
that offers significant data reduction and can be used in an in situ
environment. Using the proposed multivariate data summaries, we perform various
multivariate post-hoc analyses like query-driven visualization and
sampling-based visualization. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple
real-world multivariate scientific datasets.  To demonstrate the efficacy of
our framework in an in situ environment, we apply it on a large-scale flow
simulation.
