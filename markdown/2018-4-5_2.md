Efficient feature exploration in large-scale data sets using traditional
post-hoc analysis approaches is becoming prohibitive due to the bottleneck
stemming from I/O and output data sizes. This problem becomes more challenging
when an ensemble of simulations are required to run for studying the influence
of input parameters on the model output. As a result, scientists are inclining
more towards analyzing the data in situ while it resides in the memory. In situ
analysis aims at minimizing expensive data movement while maximizing the
resource utilization for extraction of important information from the data. In
this work, we study the evolution of rotating stall in jet engines using data
generated from a large-scale flow simulation under various input conditions.
Since the features of interest lack a precise descriptor, we adopt a fuzzy
rule-based machine learning algorithm for efficient and robust extraction of
such features. For scalable exploration, we advocate for an off-line learning
and in situ prediction driven strategy that facilitates in-depth study of the
stall. Task-specific information estimated in situ is visualized interactively
during the post-hoc analysis revealing important details about the inception
and evolution of stall. We verify and validate our method through comprehensive
expert evaluation demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.
