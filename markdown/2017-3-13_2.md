**Problem**: This work studies the input parameters (multi-resolution
convective parameters) of multi-resolution climate simulations. Domain experts
are specifically interested in: the correlations between parameters in the same
resolution (intra-resolution correlation visualization) and the difference
between parametersâ€™ correlations in different resolutions (inter-resolution
correlation comparison). It is also critical to build the connection between
the multi-resolution convective parameters and the large spatial-temporal
climate ensemble outputs.

**Proposed Solution**: Based on the requirements from domain experts, we
propose an augmented design of parallel coordinates plots, called Nested
Parallel Coordinates Plot (NPCP), to visualize the multi-resolution convective
parameters in climate modeling. This new design of PCP has been integrated into
a visual analytics system, which is equipped with multiple coordinated views,
to help domain scientists build the connection between complex input parameter
settings and spatial temporal ensemble outputs.
