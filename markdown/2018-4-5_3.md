Occlusion management is an important task for three dimension data exploration.
For egocentric data exploration, the occlusion problems, caused by the camera
being too close to opaque data elements, have not been well addressed by
previous studies. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to resolve
these problems and provide an occlusion free egocentric data exploration. Our
system utilizes a state transition model to monitor both the camera and the
data, and manages the initiation, duration, and termination of deformation with
animation. Our method can be applied to multiple types of scientific datasets,
including volumetric data, polygon mesh data, and particle data. We demonstrate
our method with different exploration tasks, including camera navigation,
isovalue adjustment, transfer function adjustment, and time varying
exploration. We have collaborated with a domain expert and received positive
feedback.
