![Sampling and Recovery with Bitmap Indexing](images/2018-4-5/wei_1.png)

Creating a data representation is a common approach for efficient and effective
data management and exploration. The compressed bitmap indexing is one of the
emerging data representation used for large-scale data exploration. Performing
sampling on the bitmapindexing based data representation allows further
reduction of storage overhead and be more flexible to meet the requirements of
different applications. In this paper, we propose two approaches to solve two
potential limitations when exploring and visualizing the data using
sampling-based bitmap indexing data representation.  First, we propose an
adaptive sampling approach called information guided stratified sampling
(IGStS) for creating compact sampled datasets that preserves the important
characteristics of the raw data.  Furthermore, we propose a novel data recovery
approach to reconstruct the irregular subsampled dataset into a volume dataset
with regular grid structure for qualitative post-hoc data exploration and
visualization. The quantitative and visual efficacy of our proposed data
sampling and recovery approaches are demonstrated through multiple experiments
and applications.
