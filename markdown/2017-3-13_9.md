Data partitioning becomes necessary when a large-scale simulation produces more
data than can be feasibly stored.  The goal is to partition the data, typically
so that every element belongs to one and only one partition, and store summary
information about the partition, either a representative value plus an estimate
of the error or a distribution.  Once the partitions are determined and the
summary information stored, the raw data is discarded. This process can be
performed in situ, meaning while the simulation is running. 

When creating the partitions there are many decisions that must be made.  For
instance, how to determine once an adequate number of partitions have been
created, how are the partitions created with respect to dividing the data, or
how many variables should we consider simultaneously.  In addition, decisions
must be made for how to summarize the information within each partition.
Because of the combinatorial number of possible ways to partition and summarize
the data, a method of comparing the different possibilities will help guide
researchers into choosing a good partitioning and summarization scheme for
their application. In this work we will present a metric (pAIC)
that was created to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and storage cost.
