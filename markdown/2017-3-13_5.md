**Problem**: 

- Existing region-based statistical data summaries rely upon regular
  partitioning  that results in partitions with high data value variation and
  uncertainty leading to increased sampling error is analysis 
- Visualizations produced from these statistical data summarizations introduce
  artifacts and distortions making visual analysis less effective

**Solution**: 

- We propose a homogeneous region guided data partitioning which employs a fast
  clustering algorithm SLIC for in situ partition generation 
- SLIC based homogeneous partitions are summarized using a hybrid distribution
  scheme of either a single Gaussian or mixture of Gaussians per partition
- Extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons of our method with regular
  partitioning and k-d tree based partitioning reveal that our method is
  superior in quality vs storage trade-off and can be performed in situ in a
  scalable way
