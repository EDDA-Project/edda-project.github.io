In flow visualization and analysis, particle tracing is a fundamental technique
for visualizing and analyzing flow fields. By tracing particles in the data
domain, users can conduct many applications, for example, generating
streamlines or pathlines, tracking particles from source to destination regions
for source-destination queries, or computing FTLE fields to characterize the
boundary of flow fields. In particle tracing, we always need to handle large
data and the computational costs are expensive, so scalable and parallel
solutions are needed.

However, it is likely that the workload is imbalanced.  We proposed two
solutions to address these problems. The first one is a dynamic load-balancing
method based on data repartitioning for parallel particle tracing, as shown in
top-half of the Figure. During run time, we periodically perform data
repartitioning to balance the workload of each process based on the estimation
of the block workload.

We studied this data-repartitioning method with different data sets on Vesta, a
Blue Gene/Q supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. Compared with other
load-balancing algorithms, our method does not need any preprocessing on the
raw data and does not require any dedicated process for work scheduling, while
it has the capability to balance uneven workload efficiently. The performance
study shows improved load balance and high efficiency of this method on tracing
particles in both steady and unsteady flow.

However, the this method still requires data block movement during run time,
which makes it difficult to scale up. This observation prompted us to design a
load-balancing algorithm from the perspective of particle distribution.
Therefore, we proposed the second method, a dynamically load-balanced algorithm
using k-d (short for k-dimensional) trees, which uses k-d tree decomposition to
periodically evenly redistribute particles across processes for load balancing.
Our final solution is a novel redesign of k-d tree decomposition, namely, the
constrained k-d tree, to redistribute particles in the data-parallel particle
tracing, as shown in bottom-half of the Figure.

This constrained k-d tree method has also been evaluated with various flow
visualization and analysis tasks on Vesta. With up to 8K parallel processes, we
demonstrated that compared with the baseline data-parallel particle tracing
method, our constrained k-d tree approach significantly improves the
performance in both load balancing and scalability.
