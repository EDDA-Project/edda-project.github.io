Computing power has increased faster than the amount of storage bandwidth or the ability to read stored data. Thus, researchers can perform large-scale, high-resolution simulations, but they are unable to load all the data into local memory. Performing queries becomes necessary; however, as the size of the data increases, queries will also be time-consuming.  Bitmap indexing was originally developed for faster query processing of read-mostly data, but has recently been used for scientific data management. It consists of a set of bit vectors, where one vector corresponds to a distinct attribute value or range of values. Each bit is mapped to a record, and the bit value is 1 if the record matches the property in focus.  Bitmap indexing is able to perform complex logical operations quickly, but for floating-point attributes, the bitmap indexing will be lossy because the bit vector values must be binned.  Different strategies have been proposed to bin bit vectors value.  

A review of the current literature on bitmap indexing has identified the need for a comparative error metric to assess the binning scheme of bit vectors.  This metric will incorporate multiple, conflicting criteria, such as query processing speed and index size, provide uncertainty on the assessment, and allow for a sensitivity analysis. This error metric will eventually be used as the bitmap index is being created in situ to indicate when the current binning strategy is no longer optimal.
